minify.js
=========

A set of online tools for those who know enough about web programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but are not very proficient in using automatic build tools to minify their files. These people, usually just need a kind of tool that allows them to paste certain data into a text area and then to click on a submit button to get the results quickly. For example, to minify CSS and JavaScript files.

Please don&rsquo;t try to suggest me to utilize some automatic build tools such as Jekyll and Hugo for now. I didn&rsquo;t have plans to make this project to be updated regularly, and I have no plans to add many pages in it. Thanks.
